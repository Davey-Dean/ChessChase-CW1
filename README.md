# Chess Chase

This is a 10 minute demo of a game created for the Game Design and Development module at the University of Southampton. 

This game was created by myself and another student within Unity, we were tasked with developing a short segment of a game where you demonstrate a core dynamic. The core dynamic for this game is "Chase and Evade", which is highlighted by the gameplay involving having the player evade enemies that move like chess pieces (I.e. a bishop can only move diagonally). The goal of each level is to find the enemy king and capture them.
