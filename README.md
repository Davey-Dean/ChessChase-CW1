# Chess Chase

This is a 10 minute demo of a game creating for the Game Design and Development module at the University of Southampton. 

This game was created by myself and another student where we were tasked with developing a short segment of a game where you demonstrate a core dynamic. The core dynamic for this game is "Chase and Evade".
